        The estimated amount of water that will be absorbed during the brewing process based on the mass of the coffee
        grounds used.  For example, if this value is 2.3 and the amount of coffee you\'re brewing is 20g, the
        calculation will assume 46g (2.3 * 20) of water will be absorbed.  Tweak this number accordingly based on
        actual yield.
